        <h1>Myka&apos;s Spotify Wrapped 2021</h1>
        
        <p>Every end of the year, Spotify creates a playlist of the Top 100 songs you were listening to throughout the whole year. I think it&apos;s really cool, because they put them up by ranking. The ranking is based on how many times you&apos;ve played the song. I&apos;ve listened to various songs by different artists. So, it was a bit interesting for me to see what my Top 10 songs were. Some songs that made it were unexpected, and some were to no surprise. Now, let&apos;s have a look of: 
        </p>

        <h2>My Top 10 Songs of 2021</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>BTS- "Butter"</li>
          <li>Agust D - “People”</li>
          <li>Agust D - “Moonlight”</li>
          <li>BTS - “Life Goes On”</li>
          <li>BTS - “Film Out”</li>
          <li>Crush ft. Devin Morrison - “Let Me”</li>
          <li>Agust D ft. RM - "Strange"</li>
          <li>Doja Cat - “Love to Dream”</li>
          <li>BTS - “Love Maze”</li>
          <li>Drake with 21 Savage ft. Project Pat - “Knife Talk”</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As you can tell, BTS and Agust D are obviously my favorite artists. Interestingly, Agust D is a member of the boy group BTS. He is actually known as Suga in the band, but he goes by Agust D when doing solo projects (sort of his alter ego). I was expecting my summary to be diverse. The most surprising song for me to find on the list is Drake&apos;s “Knife Talk”. I didn&apos;t even feel like I listened to it that much. I thought I would see more Doja songs on the Top 10 because I was listening to her album Planet Her nonstop, especially all throughout the summer. But because this was based on the number of times I&apos;ve played the song it makes sense that my Top 10 wouldn&apos;t have that much variety in terms of artists.
